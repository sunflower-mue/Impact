# Impact
Description:
Impact is a project that returns a range of numbers as described in NumberRangeSummarizer.java Interface.
The project is built using [Maven] and can be edited using [Visual Studio Code --Version 1.77.3].

TreeSet() data structure is used since it handles duplicates and retuns Ascending Order values automayically.
{Saves time and memory by not having to call sort and explicitly handling duplicates}

Only a string as per requirements will be allowed. 

Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using ssh key.

Copy code:
git clone git@github.com:sunflower-mue/Impact.git

USAGE:

Use open Folder Option to open Impact on Visual Studio Code to run test cases.

GroupingTest.java has testcases to meet the minimum requirements.

Cases such as null, empty string or invalid input were handled but no testcases are provided for this(JUnit limitations and Efficiency to handle Illegal Exceptions
-- A learning process after this submission)

class file in target can be deleted since this code will be run through testcases only and not through the main method.

Finally all dependencies are on the pom.xml outside the src folder.

Room for improvement and it commences now. :)
